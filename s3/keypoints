access points

Storage Classes:
Standard: 
Default storage, no charge to upload, egress charged, no retrival fee, charged per GB of data, no minimum object size, no minimum duration
Standard IA: 
egress charge + data retrival fee
minimum storage duration is 30 days, if you store an object for 5 days and delete it, you will still be charged for 30 days
min object size is 128 Kb, even your object size is 1 Kb you will be charged for 128 Kb
onezone-Infrequent Access:
sames as standard Infrequent access, but data is stored in only one AZ

Glacier Instant:
min charged for 90 days
min object size is 128 Kb
ideal for archived data which needs to be accessed immediately

Glacier Flexible:
data cant be retrived immediately, has retrival fee, min duration 90 days
min object size  40 Kb

glacier Deep Archive:
cant be retrived immediately
min duration is 180 days 
min object size is 40 Kb

Intelligent tiering:
automatically moves data between various storage classes
automation cost per 1000 objects
