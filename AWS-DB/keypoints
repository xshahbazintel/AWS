CAP: 
consistency: every node in a cluster gives you same, most recent and successful write
availability: Availability means that each read or write request for a data item will either be processed successfully or will receive a message that the operation cannot be completed.
partition tolerance: Partition tolerance means that the system can continue operating even if the network connecting the nodes has a fault that results in two or more partitions, where the nodes in each partition can only communicate among each other.

ACID AND BASE are are transaction models
ACID: atomic, consistent,, independent, durable
generally refers to relational database systems
limits to scaling

BASE: basic available, soft state, eventually consistent
offers high scalability

when should you run DB on EC2:
when you need os level access of DB
when you want a specific version of DB that aws wont provide
when your application needs os/db composition
advance db tuning
vendor requirements
architechture aws wont provide


RDS:
Multi AZ Instance mode:
there are two instances primary and standby
primary will always serve read and write  operations, no way standby will serve you read or writes
standby will by syncing synchronus with primary db to keep data in sync
aws will take snapshots from standby and replicate in multiple azs
Multi AZ cluster mode:
in cluster mode there will be 1 Write mode and 2 Read mode instances
write mode instance perform write operations and read operations too
read mode instances will strictly perform read operations
write is confirmed by write instance only when atleast read instance confirms it
failover is fast compared to instance mode
writes are faster, first db writes to instance store and flushes it to EBS
replication is via transaction logs


snapshots and Automated Backups:
you cant see snapshots or backups in s3 bucket even it gets stored there, aws managed those, you can see in rds instance but you cant access it
snapshots:
you have to take snapshot, aws wont handle it 
you have to delete and manage those, even if you delete RDS, snapshots wont be deleted
you have to take snapshots more frequently for less data loss
Automated Backups:
aws will handle this
window period is 0 to 35 days, the days for which backup can present
after 35 days backup will be deleted
when you delete the rds backups also be deleted also you can mention days for which current backups can be retained
but this will also be deleted after retention days period
this will save transaction logs for every 5 minutes
you can save snapshots and transaction details in a different region

when you restore db from snapshot or backup this will create a new instance, new cname
restored are slow

in synchronus the data will be pushed to all replicas  but in asynchronus the data will be be pushed into its replicas and then to read replicas

synchronus means multiAZ
asynchronus means Readreplicas

Readreplicas:
this can be in same or different AZ 
can be used only for read purpose
asynchronus process, there will be lag in data compared to primary instance
low Recovery Time Objectives, can be promoted quickly to primary instance
