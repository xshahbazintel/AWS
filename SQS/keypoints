Visibility timeout:
when client consumes messages and if message is not deleted from queue,
sqs will hide messages for a period of time called Visibility timeout and the same message, appears in queue after that timeout, ideal for error processing messages

delay queues:
messages will be added to queue but message will not appear in queue for a period of time , this is usually used where you need to prepare env for processing
cant be used with fifo queues



ASGS and lambdas can scale based on queue length

queues can be
standard: same message can be delivered multiple times, cant guarentee order of messages, highly scalable
fifo: order of message is guarented, messages will be delivered in order, not scalable
