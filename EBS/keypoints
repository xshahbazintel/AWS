Storage:
Instance/local storage: just like c disk on but on server machine, not permanent, loss of data when you shutdown and restart, not ideal for persistant or permanent data eg: instance store
Network attached storage: permanent storage eg: ebs
Ephermal storage: not permanent eg: instance store
Persistent storage: permanent storage eg: ebs


BlockStorage:
stores data by dividing into blocks and stores in different locations with unique identifier 
Block storage allows direct access to individual data blocks.
this can be mountable on os also you can boot os making it blockable
ideal for large storage systems and random data access like db applications
it has limited capability to handle metadata

Filestorage:
data is stored in a structured format, like folders
for accessing the data you have to access the path of file 
File storage uses file names, the type of data in the file (extension), and a specific path to the dataâ€™s location as unique identifiers. 
inexpensive, simple and easy
Mountable but not bootable
eg: nfs

Blob storage:
Object storage is a data storage architecture where data is stored in isolated containers called objects. Object-based storage divides data into separate units that contain a unique identifier and metadata to describe the data and make it easier to access and retrieve than other types of storage.
flat structure
not mountable not bootable
eg: s3

Storage Performance:
IO(blocks): the size of the block you want to store/retrive from storage system
IOPS: No of operations you perform on the storage system
Throughput: IO*IOPS

Types:
Genreral purpose (GP2):
min 1Gb max 16TB
Io credit bucket meaning how many IO operations you can perform on EBS volume 
5.4 million, credits fills at baseline Performance
what is baseline Performance?
the min credits you will get on bucket this is 100 per second
on top of this you will get an extra of 5 for GB per second

if the size of volume is 1TB or more you will get baseline Performance of 16000IOPS
Good for  dev test envs and boot volumes, low latency interactive applications

Genreral purpose (GP3):
min 1Gb max 16TB
doesnt have bucket architecture
baseline of 3000iops and 125 MB per second
can go to 16000IOPS and 1000MB/s with extra cost

Provisioned IOPS:
 Provisioned IOPS1 and Provisioned IOPS2 can achecive ans IOPS upto 64000 and 1000MB/s Throughput
 theser are independent of volume size 
 ideal for high Performance and low latency
 min 4B and max 16TB
 io1 max is 50iops per GB io2 is 500iops per GB and block express 1000 iops per GB
 Provisioned IOPS block express can achecive IOPS of 2,56,000 and 4000MB/s Throughput
 min 4GB max 64TB
HDD:
slow when compared to GP and Provisioned IOPS 
HDD ST1: 
Throughput optimised
min 125GB max 16TB
ideal for sequential data retrival 
max 500IOPS 500 mb/s
usages: bigdata warehouses, log processing

HDD Cold:
min 125GB max 16TB
cheaper among all
used for less frequent access data
max 250IOPS 200mb/s

instance store:
Local storage attached to host server of ec2 machine
temporary storage
you can attach this only at launch time, cant attach it later
one server can attach more than one instance store volumes
when ami is changed or server is stopped and started or hardware failures or ec2 is moved between machines data will be lost

EBS Encryption:
you can encrypty one volume with one DEK
cant use same DEK for multiple volumes
snapshots use same DEK
login into system can see original data means ths system using this ebs is not aware of Encryption
data is encrypted only on volume device
