certs created by aws cm are renewed automatically, if you are using your own certs you have to manage renewal.
ACM can be used only with some aws services like loadbalancer and cloudfront, you cant use acm with ec2
when you configure loadbalancer with acm, the certificate needs to be present in the same region as in which loadbalancer is present, as acm is a regional service.
cloudfronts certificate manager will be  operated from us-east-1 as cloudfront is global service.
