Upgrading kubeadm clusters


kubeadm from version 1.31.x to version 1.32.x, and from version 1.32.x to 1.32.y (where y > x). 
Skipping MINOR versions when upgrading is unsupported
kubeadm doesnt upgrade or install kubelets
you have to do it separetely and restart kubelet once again


1. upgrade kubeadm to version you want to upgrade this can be only one minor version at a time
   kubeadm upgrade plan
   kubeadm upgrade apply
   
2. kubeapi-server should be at highest version eg: 1.31 
   kubecontroller manager and kubescheduler can be at 1.31 or 1.30
   kubelet and kubeproxy can be at 1.31 or 1.30 or 1.29

while upgrading nodes instead of drain straight 
kubectl cordon node  #this will disable scheduling
kubectl drain node
upgrade kubeadm and kubelet 
uncordon node
