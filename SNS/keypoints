Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, 
which is a logical access point and communication channel.

Clients can subscribe to the Amazon SNS topic and receive published messages using a 
supported endpoint type, such as Amazon Data Firehose, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, 
HTTP, email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages (SMS).
