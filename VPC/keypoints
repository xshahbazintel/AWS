VPC:
Aws vpc min range is /28 network providing 16 ip address and max of /16 network giving 6556 ips
vpc is a region resilient service meaning its confined to a region

Subnet:
we are breaking above created 10.16.0.0/16 vpc into small parts called subnets 
these subnets are spanned in a AZ, these are az resilient
subnets will be always in one AZ,cant span in multiple AZs
if total available ips in a subnet is 255 then you can assign only 250 to devices 
5 are not available due to 1 for networkID one for internal routing between subnets 
one for dns resolution one for future use and last ip for broadcast 

Router:
every vpc has a router associated
the router has a network interface in every subnet, this interface ip is usually networkaddress+1
route table is connected to subnet to route traffic, this route table associated with subnet
defines what the vpc router has to do with traffic
every subnet has one route table
one route table can be associated to many subnets 


IGW:
Regional resilient
one IGW can be attached to 1 vpc only
a vpc cant have a IGW making vpc completely private
when you create a public subnet, each machine in it gets a public IP, but the ip is not associated to that machine instead 
IGW wil maintain a record of the machines private IP and associated public IP.
you cant assign public IP to a resource/machine/ec2, meaning you cant assign to its os, igw will maintain a mapping


stateless firewal:

stateless firewall doesnt store information about state of connection 
you have to explictly allow inbound and outbound rules 
Stateless firewalls are fast, can handle large loads, and have historically been cheaper to purchase. However, they don't inspect traffic, require some configuration, and are somewhat outdated technology.
Eg: NACLs

NACLS:
This will operate at subnet level
only affects traffic leaving or entering into subnet 
each subnet will only have one nacl 
one nacl can be associated to many subnets

statefull firewal:

stateful firewall store information about state of connection 
if inbound is allowed outbound is allowed
you cant explicitly deny traffic for specfic ip address 
these allow or block traffic at network interface of an instance 
you can control logical resources meaning instances in subnet A can be configured to connect to instances in subnetB, this will allow you fine control of who can connect 
you can connect instances with in a subnet too using SG 


NAT GATEWAY:
AZ resilient, you need to have one NAT gateway in each AZ
need to run in public subnet and have a public IP 
you will be charged for both nat gateway and data transfer cost
cant be used as jump/bastion host
nat gateway cant be associated with a SG only nacl are supported
cannot work with ipv6
you need route table for each AZ as nat gateway is AZ connected, you cant route trafic for NAT gateway in AZA from subnet in AZB


disable source destination check: when you ping or send traffic from one instance to another, the instance will check if the ping is meant for it, while you are using a server as nat server you have to disable source destination check because the traffic is to be forwarded to another server.
