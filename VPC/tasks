1 create a vpc with two instances one in public and one in pribate subnets
  private instances need to communicate with s3 using gateway endpoints
  In this task we have to select vpc in which we want to place endpoints and
  route table that this gateway endpoint should use, if you want a instance in a subnet to use this endpoint
  make sure you select the same route table that the instance is associated to, if you want all instances should use this select all routetables

2. create interface endpoints
   create 1 instance in public and 1 in private subnet
   private subnets need to communicate with sqs using gateway endpoints
   in this we have to select subnets where this interface endpoint is to be deployed
   this will deploy an ENI into that subnet
   create or select SG for this ENI
   this SG should allow http inbound traffic as ENI will receive traffic from instances
   
3. create vpc provider and vpc consumer, connect to services in vpc provider from vpc consumer using private link
   create provider vpc range 10.200.0.0/16
   create 2 subnets 1 for launching webserver 1 for nlb
   create securitygroup for webserver, this should accept inbound traffic from vpc range i.e 10.200.0.0/16
   create a target group for target type as instance and this should listen tcp traffic on port 80
   tcp port because we are going to create nlb, which works with tcp and udp, and add vpcb webserver to this target group
   create nlb, place it in nlb subnet, sg rules pending
   com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0eb77dbdb552a5891
   create a vpc-endpoint-service point that to nlb, copy the service name

   create a service consumer vpc, vpc cidr range 10.100.0.0/16
   create 2 subnets 1 public 1 private
   launch server from public subnet, 
   this SG should have inbound rule ssh from 0.0.0.0/0
   outbound rule allow ssh to sg of private subnet or 10.100.0.0/16
   launch server from private subnet, 
   this SG should have inbound ssh rule from vpc range
   outbound tcp 80
   vpc endpoint sg rules
   inbound tcp from private server sg or vpc range
   outbound tcp 80 to vpc range
   create vpcendpoint service type PrivateLink Ready partner services, service name should be endpointservice create in consumer vpc com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0eb77dbdb552a5891
   vpc is consumer vpc, select subnet where you want to create this endpoint

   vpc b sg

   nlb inbound sg tcp 80 from vpc a range
   outbound to tcp 80 to webserver sg or vpc b range

   webserver sg rule
   inbound tcp 80
   outbound deny all
