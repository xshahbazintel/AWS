NACLS:
This will operate at subnet level
only affects traffic leaving or entering into subnet 
each subnet will only have one nacl 
one nacl can be associated to many subnets
you can deny or allow specific traffic from an IP address
you may have multiple rules, rules are evaluted in number order, low number has high priority
this is stateless, meaning doesnt know state of connection if its inbound or outbound

SG:
stateful firewall store information about state of connection 
if inbound is allowed outbound is allowed
you cant explicitly deny traffic for specfic ip address 
these allow or block traffic at network interface of an instance 
you can control logical resources meaning instances in subnet A can be configured to connect to instances in subnetB, this will allow you fine control of who can connect 
you can connect instances with in a subnet too using SG


Let us assume you have inbound rule to allow SSH access from 0.0.0.0/0
and no outbound rule, can you ssh to another system as SG are stateful
No you cant ssh, you have to have outbound ssh rule too
