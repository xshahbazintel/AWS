Load balancer distributes load between your ec2 instances or compute services in aws
load balancer can be internet facing or private 
internet facing load balancer can distribute load to non internet facing compute instances
a min of 8+ free ips are needed for loadbalancer a min of /27 or /28 subnet
crosszone load balancer can load balance between availability zones

Application Load Balancer:
operate on layer7 of OSI model, application layer
terminates the connection at loadbalancer and creates a new connection to instance
used for http and https based connections
can perform path based routing, location based routing, session stickiness and cookies
you can perform health checks 

Network Load Balancer:
operate on network layer of OSI model
can be used for interupppted connections as connections are not terminated at loadbalancer
can used for whitelising ips 
very fast can handle million of connections
can be used for other than http and https protocols based routing like ssh, smtp
can be used for private link 


ssl offload:
bridge: terminates connection at load balancer check packet, creates a new connection and send it to ec2 or compute
passthrough: simply forwards the connection to compute
offload: terminates connection at load balancer and forwards payload to compute without ssl connection
